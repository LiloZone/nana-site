sobreCabecalho: Tutorials
sobreTexto: Nana is a kit developed to create physical drafts on wearables. Quickly prototyping an idea, testing, playing and seeing how things work. There is no better way to plan an end product than experimentation itself. Therefore, the kit contains modules that fit and detach easily. Mount, dismount and explore as many paths as you want! To start and develop people in this world, we have created several tutorials that illustrate the possibilities of the kit and allow us to learn progressively about the various concepts covered - electronics, programming, digital manufacturing, flexible conductive materials, etc. Check out the tutorials that we make available in a totally open form!

tutoriaisEletronicaTexto: You know nothing about electronics and programming? Do not worry! With Nana you'll be able to put together complete designs like clothes with LEDs, handbags with light sensors and hats that sound. Learn progressively, from basic to advanced.

basicoCabecalho: Basic Tutorials
basicoTexto: Basic tutorials introduce concepts of electronics such as electrical circuits, inputs and actuators and also provide the first contact with flexible conductive materials. They can be made entirely with the basic Nana kit, without programming.
basico1: Bike Glove
linkBasico1: 
basico2: Necklace with LEDs
basico3: Mask with motor

intermediarioCabecalho: Intermediate Tutorials
intermediarioTexto: Intermediate tutorials extend functionality using the Arduino module (purchased separately), which allows you to program the actuators (for example, to make an LED turn on and off at certain times) and to use sensors such as light sensor.
intermediario1: T-shirt with LED blinking
intermediario2: Hat with sound
intermediario3: Light sensor bag

avancadoCabecalho: Advanced Tutorials
avancadoTexto: Finally, advanced tutorials explore more complex projects including new features like wireless bluetooth communication with apps. They also add pneumatic technologies or experimentation with other types of conductive materials.
avancado1: Bluetooth "hatset"
avancado2: Touch-sensitive embroidery
avancado3: Inflatable Collar
avancado4: Conductive Temporary Tattoo
