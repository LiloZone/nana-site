metodologiaCabecalho: NANA kit contains methods
metodologiaTexto: Beyond the modular parts, NANA is a way of thinking wearables. It has a methodology of ideation, with a board and cards where it is possible to create a wearable for a character and to know a repertoire of possibilities. In addition, it has tutorials that allow you to build step-by-step projects, from the most basic to the most advanced. All this made available in an open way!

metodoTabuleiroCabecalho: Board and Cards
metodoTabuleiroTexto: The board is the environment to create a prototype from an unusual story. Ideation cards bring narrative elements (character, feature, object, body part, etc.). Reference cards bring materials and technological methods as a suggestion to work on the challenge.
